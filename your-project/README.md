## About guessing the number
My game is all about both, chances (AI mode) and knowledge (PvP). In the first one we can try the usual "Guess the nuumber" game, you choose a number inside a range and then u check if it matches the AI one. But the second one, is more about a trivial, where one of the players asks the other for the number he is thinking about, but not in a random way, so this player has to give more information about this number that can be absolutely anything (Date, binary code, average iincome for each GOT chapter...), imagination is the limit.

I have chosen this one just because of that, it is indeed true that it is actualy quite simple, but it is as simple as creative and flexibe, you can do (almost) whatever you want with it!

## Workflow
First of all, I started thinking about possibilities. Of course, the most important part of this project was choosing a game that matches whatever you want to do with it, but once you have your skills and ideas clear, it is all about working on it.

I find brainstorming pretty useful for these kind of projetcs, as we are humans that can not process every possibility in our mind and selecting the best one. So i must say that I think that this tool is very useful in these cases. It is all about imaginating, creating and experimenting.

Personally I created a set of interesting outputs (as using points and username for rankings, getting the AI telling you if your guess is bigger (or smaller) than his number or guessing a few times in a row). After thinking about that, I chose what I found the best, and so I started coding to check if it was a good idea.

When you have the ideas clear, you just need to try them coding to see the flaws of them, to polish them and get the work completed.

## Organization
Trello was a really good help, even if it summarizes quite a lot and it is a non-explicit help, still you can make up your mind from it anytime.
